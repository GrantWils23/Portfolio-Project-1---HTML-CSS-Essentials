Welcome to my HTML and CSS main milestone project.

The basis for this project will be: 

An informative website on the castles of Great Britain. In this website, the user will be able to explore from a range of seven beuatiful castles of the UK which can be naviagated from the the top "from a dropdown menu" and "at the bottom with the castles listed out" of the index.html file. This website will serve as a place for people interested in casstles who want to learn more about these castles and see what they have to offer. There will also be a "contact us" form for people who wish to get in touch with us with any general enquiries and also we will have a Sign Up form that will be there for people who wish to sign up to reciever discounts and offers regarding the castles.

<h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Design style</h3>
<li><b>Colour scheme</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>The colour scheme chosen are  subtle tones of light Rose and cream colours to give the style  of old parchment paper. the colours settled on are Seashell for the background and mistyrose for the footer. and for signup and contact us "rgb(235, 154, 96)" which is a deeper browner colour to give greater visual differences.</li>
    </ol>
<li><b>Font type</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>The font types chosen are Crimson text and Cardo for the text, using google fonts to suggest complimentary fonts. Backup default fonts were chosen in the event that if it doesn't load there is a similar style that two would work well for the webpages.</li>
    </ol>
<li><b>Images and pictures</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>Images pictures and placements are important to this project. large hero images offer striking castles to draw the users attantion. The images used are to be dramatic and captivating. Images in the castle pages are modest and take up less space to draw more focus on the body of the text.</li>
    </ol>

<li><b>Layout</b></li>
    <ol>
        <li>The layout of the site is really important. It is designed to give the user a simplistic viewing and retain a uncluttered appeal to the site. helping draw more focus on readability without making the site reading experience to be exhausting. The design is to maximize comfort of the user experience.</li>
    </ol>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link" target="_blank">W3C Validator CSS</a> - <a href="https://github.com/GrantWils23/Portfolio-Project-1---HTML-CSS-Essentials/blob/main/assets/w3c-css-validator-results.pdf">results here</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/" target="_blank">W3C Validator HTML</a> - <a href="https://github.com/GrantWils23/Portfolio-Project-1---HTML-CSS-Essentials/blob/main/assets/w3c-html-validator-index-page-results.pdf">results here</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Testing User Stories</h3>
<h4>First Time User</h4>
<p>As a user </p>

<br>

<h3> Responsive Testing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Responsive design was tested across multiple platforms to ensure smooth compatability between major, popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Samsung Internet and Safari.</li>
    <li>The website was viewed on many devices using developer tools on Chrome to check page reacting to JQueries screen sizes varying from Desktop, Ipad Pro, Samsung and Iphone model phones</li>
    <li>Links Where checked extensively to make sure all links work correctly and that any external source links open outside of the page.</li>
    <li>Friends and family helped implement the design and gave constructive critisism on how to improve the page and to notify me of any bugs they came across during their experience with the website</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Iframes that appear in the castle pages refuse to connect from Google Maps Creating a gray window of an uninteractive window - element was fixed by embedding the iframe tag rather than using the google maps link.</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer doesn't support some of of the CSS3 features creating a less user friendly experience on this browser.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<hr>

<h3> Deployment to Github Pages</h3>
    <li>To showcase this project, GitHub pages were used. Steps to deploy to GitHub pages are stated below...</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub repository.</li>
        <li>At the top of the repository there is a settings menu, click on that and head to the section labelled pages.</li>
        <li>Inside the GitHub pages menu, under sources, click into the dropdown and change it from "None" to "Main Branch".</li>

        <li>Scroll through the page and locate the new published link in the GitHub pages section.</li>
    </ol>
<br>

<h3>Forking a Repository</h3>
    <li>Forking the repository allows you to make changes to the files by making a copy of the original whilst we can work on a seperate branch that will not effect the original. The steps to do this are below...</li>
    <ol>
        <li>To fork a repository, go to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.</li>
        <li>In the repository menu, there is a fork button in the top right hand corner. click this button.</li>
        <li>Now that you have clicked the button, you should have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
<br>

<h3>Making a Local Clone</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Log into GitHub and find the GitHub <a href="">Repository</a>.</li>
        <li>Underneath the repository's name, click "Clone or Download".</li>
        <li>Copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS", clone the repository using HTTPS.</li>
        <li>Open Git Bash</li>
        <li>Chnage the current working directory to the local one where you wish the clone to be placed.</li>
        <li>type <i>Git Clone</i>, and then paste the link you copy above from step 3.</li>
        <li>Press Enter, now your computer will copy the file and place the clone in your local folder.</li>
    </ol>
