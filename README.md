Welcome to my HTML and CSS main milestone project.

The basis for this project will be: 

An informative website on the castles of Great Britain. In this website, the user will be able to explore from a range of seven beuatiful castles of the UK which can be naviagated from the the top "from a dropdown menu" and "at the bottom with the castles listed out" of the index.html file. This website will serve as a place for people interested in casstles who want to learn more about these castles and see what they have to offer. There will also be a "contact us" form for people who wish to get in touch with us with any general enquiries and also we will have a Sign Up form that will be there for people who wish to sign up to reciever discounts and offers regarding the castles

The castle pages will display clear and readable information that will be intersting to the reader. The Castle pages will have some infromation about the castles and a stat box regarding age and sizes of the castle for example. The intention is that for people who are interested in these castles to go and see them for themselves so the pages will consist of Iframes to show the location on the castles on Google maps so the user can quickly locate the castle and see if it is easy to reach and in this site we will link to the main pages of the Trusts and Castle websites for users who wish to know more about the castles and what they have to offer. Also there will be a link directly to the bookings page for those who wish to see the castle of their choice.

All pages are to be responsive in design and will incourage the user to come back to the website in the future as the simplistic design should make it appealing and easy on the eye. Below are some of the attached wireframe templates that have been produced on how the website has been designed from day one, this will change ever so slightly over time as I get user feedback from people on what improvements can be made to add in the strength of British-Castles. Where staggered elements are to be displayed in a desktop environment, pages with these elements will respond to small screen sizes by creating a one line dimension principle, so that the elements are not scattered over the screen on a small device.

Here are some of worked early concept designs that I have from the first Brainstorming session that I have done...
