            <h2>Cardiff Castle</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="castle-text">
            <p> In 1066, William the Conqueror, defeat King Harold II at the battle of Hasting, Upon being crowned King William, and establishing a foothold of castles in England, he then set his sights on conqueroring the rest of the Wales. To do this, the Norman King
                had done what the Normans where most famous for, build castles to establish their dominance over the region. This is where the birth of the origins for the castle take place. Upon arriving at Cardiff, the Normans found the remians of an old Roman fort that
                was built here protecting the Romman soldiers over a thousand years ago. This would lay the foundation to what is Cardiff Castle. Even to this day you can see some segments of wall that were left from the Romans. The normals took this opportunity to build upon them. 
                <br><br>
                This Castle is a typical Motte and Bailey design with a moat surrounding the motte. The strong fortifications allowed this place to be used as a prison, or as a place to live. whilst on the bailey you could have all your dwellings, such as an armoury, barracks and
                stables inside the perimeter walls. This fort was perfect for defending yourselves from potential welsh aggressors apposing the new King. Its first real tale of significant hsitory comes after teh Death of William the Conqueror, were his three sons all wanted to succeed
                him in the throne. Robert the Eldest lost the thrown to his brother Henry but after an accident, Henry unfortunately died and whilst Robert was out on a Crusade abroad, William his youngest brother siezes his chance and makes a grab for the throne. This enraged Robert, 
                So he ammassed an army to challange his brother for the throne. they battled in Normandy and Robort lost, but William did not kill his brother, he Locked him away and threw away the key.
                He was imprisoned in the West country for 20 years before in 1126 being moved to Cardiff Castle, where he would spend the remainder of his days a prisoner to the King.
                <br><br>
                Rubert Curthose wouldn't be the last prisoner within the wall of the castles. In the 14th century, the castle fell into the hands of a family of nobles called the Despensers. This castle reputation changed drastically at the hands of the Despensers. It quickly became a symbol
                 of English authority and power and Hugh Despenser the younger then proved to be one of the most merciless, blood-thirsty and hated men.Hugh Despenser was very friendly with Edward II, one of Englands most unpopular Kings who came to the thrown in 1307. Hugh used his power 
                and friendship with the King to gain power over Cardiff Castle. From here he reigned in terror, tyranny and corruption that eventually would shake the whole kingdom. In 1316 there was a famine due to poor weather. and a local Welsh Lord by the name of Llywelyn Bren raised a revolt
                against the King. later that year the King sent out 2000 men to confront and fight him. He surrendered and asked that it be just him and not his people that get punished. in 1318 he got transferred to Cardiff Castle were he fell into the hands of the foul Hugh Despenser.
                Despenser used his power to showcase his authority and had Bren Hanged, drawn and Quartered.
                <br><br>
                Hugh Despensers managed to reak havoc over the country for the next four years. but his influence estranged the Kings wife Queen Isabella, Now the Queen teamed up with another Welsh Baron from the Welsh borders called Roger Mortimor. They luanched an inavsion to overthrow the unpopular 
                king and put his menacing right hand man Despenser in prison. He was sentence to the same miserable horrible death that he subjected onto Bren, He was hanged, drawn and quartered. It is said whilst imprisoned, he tired to starve himself to death, but there was to be no escape. In the castle, 
                there you can see a stain glass window of him with his coat of arms placed upside down as a sign of his disgrace and shame. 
                <br><br>
                The Castle then would go onto see some of the bloodiest battles in Wales history. At the start of the 15th century, the last great rising against the English began. Owen Glyndwr claimed the title Prince of Wales, he led a revolt against King Henry IV. In 1483 his men burned down the city of Cardiff
                and placed the catle under siege. With little resources left to muster upon, the castle surrendered, but not before it was badly damaged. It was a famous victory for Wales and Glyndwr. years later after this victory the English King Henry IV regained control of South Wales and passed a new law "The Penal Law"
                which brought an apartheid towards the welsh, stripping the welsh of many rights. during this time, there was relative peace and the castle then fell in the hands of lords who spent their money on improving the castles grounds and decor. But unfortunately that wasn't the end of the castle's share of violence.
                in 1642, increasingly hostilities between King Charles I and his enemies in parliment. this Errupted into the British Civil War. This war came to the streets of Cardiff and to the gates of teh castle where the Roundheads and the Cavaliers clashed for nine years. During this time the Castle swapped hands between 
                the two factions as the war raged on spilling blood everywhere.
                <br><br>
                The castle was badly damaged but it had a turn of good fortune in the shape of a wedding, whereby an heiress by the name of Charlotte Jane Windsor in 1766 married Lord Mount Stuart. Not did it just change the fortunes of the Castle but the City of Cardiff itself. They set about changing the castle into a Georgian 
                mansion. The coal required to power the industrial revoltion saw work in the city booming and this created work and wealth for the Bute family which they could reinvest in their home. Coal was such a big industry that it changed the fortunes of not just the Butes but of the entire city. 
                Coal was being sold all over the world and Cardiff was working overtime, more than happy to supply it. The Butes built the docks and the money kept rolling in. Over the generations, the wealth that the Bute aquired saw the castle change from a castle to a gothic palace. In 1865, John the 
                third Marquess of Bute hired William Burges the architect to completely revamp the interior design. 
                <br><br>
                Its last real fight as a castle was seen as late as 1939, when the Nazis targetted Cardiff with bombing raids to slow down Britians war effort and to pummel them into submittion. In the process of these raids, 33,000 homes were bombed and 400 civilians killed as the Nazis targetted Bute Docks. Seeing as the castle 
                was buit to withstand barages of canon fire, the castle seemed like a good place to protect the inhabitance of Cardiff below ground. you can explore these tunnels today. This gorgeous castle is really amazing and its rich history makes it a perfect place to go and see. with wonderful acrhitecture in the grounds of the castle 
                and a the glamour of 19th century gothic design, there are not many castles that go onto change the fortunes of a whole city and changed the landscape quite like it.
