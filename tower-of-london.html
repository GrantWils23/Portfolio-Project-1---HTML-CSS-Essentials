            <h2>Tower of London</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="castle-text">
            <p>This is the Tower of London, the Capital of London and as a capital it was very important to have a magnificent castle to display your authority as king of
                your country and those dare cross you ought to think twice before going against the crown. This castle played a hugely important role in the development of London as
                city and is home to many truely grizzly stories from kings gone. It played its part in the history of the persecution towards many figures living in England at the time.
                <br><br>
                The castle was originally constructed in the 11th century and it was created by William the Conqueror after the Norman invasion in 1066. It was hated by many when
                it first was constructed as it represented the oppression of the people from the ruling elite. London at the time was the largest town in England and so he set to make it the
                capital of his governance. originally the castle was made of timber but timber is not great for longevity so they set to started to turn to stone, afterall to protect one self from the unruly 
                peasent, one must have a fortification to keep themselves safe. So they begun building the White Tower out of stone, while the rest of the grounds would be developed over time.
                <br><br>
                The castle was used as a treasury and under Edward I reign in 1275 to 1285, Edward started to remodel the castle as he himself was a avid castle builder. he help to make the castle more self-sufficenet by adding two watermills.
                During this time, it was very common for coin clipping to take place, and it this was greatly annoying the King as he to build lavish castles he needed money. The problem was so vast, that it led to the persecution of Jewish people
                as the king saw to blame them for the clipping of coins and used them as a scapegoat to thereby create a singular-system centralised mint within the Tower of London and controlled by the King. This saw 600 Jews being imprisoned in
                the tower in 1278. 
                <br><br>
                This castle has seen riots where it saw the "Peasents Revolt" take place in 1381 where the gates where siezed and the folk of London rose against the elite opposing Richard II 
                It has found itself evolving over the years and has been used as a prison, In the 16th century it gained a reputation as a foul, foridding prison where people. It served as a prison to political prisoners and high enemies of the state.
                It is even believed that the ghost of Anne Boleyn haunts the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. It is said that you can see her ghost walking around the white tower with her body carrying her head under her arm.
                <br><br>
                The Tower also became infamous to the story "Princes in the Tower," where it is believed that the notorious murder of Edwards IV two prince sons. The tail goes that after their fathers death, Edward V (the prince) was too young to become King,
                so his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector, and would eventually give reign to him at his coming of age. Edward and his younger brother Richard were believed to be held in the tower. It has traditionally been thought
                that the most likely reason for their disappearence was that the Duke killed them so that he could then rule to become King. The princes last public apperance was in June 1483, shortly after the Duke was proclaimed King Richard III in the same month.
                Bones have thought to been discovered which could very well belong to the two princes but they have never been tested, so the story is left without a decisive answer... <i>"What happened to the Two Princes?"</i>  
                <br><br>
                In the modern era the castle has been open to tourism, it even was once used as a zoo to gain public attention, which later on went on to become the zoo in regents park.
                It is one of the most visited castles in the UK as when tourist come to London it is in the heart of the city and is right next to the river Thames. It pulls people in their millions every year thanks to
                its connections to the royal family. Most recently it is famous for playing home to the crown jewel of her majesty "the Queen" Elizabeth the Second where it has been doing so for the 
                best part of 600 years. It still possesses some military capacity till this day where has guards deployed to protect the jewels.
